## Find the common ancestor
 
Imagine you are seeing a Git tree. Given list of git commits in order from latest to first and their corresponding parents if a commit has two parents, it is a merge commit. 

**Find least common ancestor of two given commits also called merge base, which is an ancestor that is closest to both given commits.**

Commits -> [G,F,E,D,C,B,A]
Parents -> [[F,D],[E],[B],[C],[B],[A],[null]]
